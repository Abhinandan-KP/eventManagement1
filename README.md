# Event Management System 🚀

Hi, I'm **Abhinandan**. This is a web-based Event Management System I built to handle event tracking, user registration, and dynamic event creation. I designed this to be a clean, responsive, and interactive frontend solution.

**🔴 Live Demo:** [https://event-management1-woad.vercel.app](https://event-management1-woad.vercel.app)

## 💡 Project Overview
I created this project to simulate how real-world event platforms work. The goal was to build a smooth user interface where users can land, authenticate, view listed events, and manage them without any clutter.

Everything handles dynamically on the client side using **Vanilla JavaScript**.

## ⚙️ How It Works
I've structured the application into logical modules:

* **Authentication Flow:** I built custom `login.html` and `register.html` pages to handle user entry.
* **Dashboard (`events.html`):** This is the core hub. It fetches and displays the event data in a grid layout.
* **Event Creation (`create.html`):** I implemented form handling here so users can input event details (Date, Name, Description) and see them reflect in the system.
* **Routing:** The `index.html` serves as the landing page directing traffic based on user action.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
I focused on core web technologies to ensure performance and control over the DOM:
* **HTML5** - For semantic structure.
* **CSS3** - Custom styling for a responsive, modern look (no heavy frameworks).
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Handles all the logic, DOM manipulation, and event listeners in `script.js`.
