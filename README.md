📅 Evently
Evently is a modern, lightweight event management platform I built to make organizing and finding local events simple and beautiful. It moves away from cluttered, old-school designs in favor of a clean, "human-centric" interface that works fast on both mobile and desktop.

✨ What this project does
Discovery Hub: A clean, organized grid where users can browse upcoming events without distractions.

Simple Creation: A dedicated page to upload event posters (images or videos) with an instant preview feature.

Fast Navigation: A custom "Glassmorphism" navigation bar that follows you as you scroll.

Smart Storage: It uses browser storage to save your events, so your data stays on your device and loads instantly.

Responsive Design: Styled with a mix of Tailwind CSS and custom CSS to ensure it looks professional on every screen size.

📂 My Project Structure
This project is built using a clean, file-based architecture:

index.html: The main landing page featuring a welcoming "Hero" section and the latest events.

events.html: A dedicated page for searching and exploring all available events.

create.html: The portal for hosting new events, including a drag-and-drop style upload area.

login.html & register.html: Clean, professional onboarding pages for users to join the community.

script.js: The engine of the app—handles event saving, media processing, and the search logic.

styles.css: Contains custom high-end design touches like blur effects and smooth animations.

🛠️ How I Built It
I focused on using modern tools that keep the website lightweight and fast:

HTML5 & Vanilla JavaScript: For the core structure and logic.

Tailwind CSS: For professional spacing, typography, and mobile-responsive layouts.

Google Fonts (Inter): Used for that crisp, premium "tech startup" look.

Local Storage API: To handle data persistence without needing a complex backend.

GitHub Actions: Integrated via static.yml to automatically deploy the site whenever I push code.

🚀 How to view it
Locally: Clone this repo and open index.html in any browser.

Live: The project is configured to deploy automatically via GitHub Actions or Vercel.
